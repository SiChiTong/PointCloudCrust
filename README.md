# PointCloudCrust Library
The PointCloudCurst is an implementation of the PointCloudCrust Algorithm (or in-officially called "Cheese-Maker") which builds a crust around a point cloud. The input of the algorithm is a list of points located in a three dimensional space plus the radius of a ball and the output is a set of triangles which defines the the "crust".
The Algorithm does not only create the outer crust but also visualize innersided holes, structures and even breakthroughs (like a cheese). A typcial practical use case of the Point Crust Algorithm is the visualization of color spaces:
